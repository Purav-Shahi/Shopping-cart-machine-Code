#Variables
#Explain variable with examples
# Example 1
a = "Hii this side Purav Shahi."
print (a)


# Example 2
name = "John"
print (name)

# If you write any kind of word which use space in between so use _ ( under score )
# or one can use _ (Under score) to separate the name while writing the variable.
# Method one without use space
Evennumber = 2
print (Evennumber)
# Method 2 With use _ (Under score)
even_number = 24
print(even_number)

#Variable name should not start with any numbers or symbols

# User input
name = input("Enter your name or identity: ") # For name
age = int(input("Enter your age:")) # for age.

# String "" Anything written between double quote

# And if  any number is in decimal so it is called Floating point
Age = float(input("Enter your age here:"))

# evalute
exp1 = eval(input("Enter your conclusion"))

# Data Casting and subtype
# There are 2 types of casting
# 1-Implicit---it covert data type one into another itself
# 2-Explicit--- user are able to convert the data into another
Name = "John"
print (type(Name))

#When adding the 2 variables
# example
a = 120
b = 1.20
c = a + b
print (type(c))
print (c)

# Swap variable method

a = 30
b = 40
#left,right = right,left
a,b = b,a
print (b)
print (a)


# Convert integers into float
a = 12
print (type(a))

a = float(a)
print (type(a))
